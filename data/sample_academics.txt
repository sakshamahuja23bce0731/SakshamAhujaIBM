Semantic Scholar provides access to a vast corpus of peer-reviewed academic papers with metadata like authors, citations, abstracts, and fields of study. This is valuable for building AI models for citation prediction, topic modeling, and research paper summarization.
The arXiv dataset consists of scientific papers in fields like computer science, physics, and mathematics. It's commonly used to train natural language processing (NLP) models for automated literature review, research trend analysis, and AI-based recommender systems for academic content.
MAG included over 200 million academic papers with structured metadata (e.g., affiliations, citations, fields of study). It was extensively used for building AI models in knowledge graph construction, co-authorship prediction, and scientific impact forecasting.
